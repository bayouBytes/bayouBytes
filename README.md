Hey there! I'm BayouBytes, a tech enthusiast with a serious soft spot for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the world of Large Language Models, training them on handpicked datasets and seeing where the current can take us.

But my digital adventures don't stop there. I'm a huge fan of all things virtual world-building. From Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) to video games and visual novels, I'm all about creating realms where we can take a break from reality. And hey, who doesn't love a good escape every now and then? 

Sure, I'm still finding my footing in these areas, but isn't that half the fun? I'm determined to keep leveling up my skills, using AI as my guide through the thick of it all. The goal isn't just to become an expert, but to embrace the perpetual learning that comes with this vast field.

So, here's to learning, growing, and transforming the digital world, one byte at a time.
