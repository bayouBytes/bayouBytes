Hey there! 👋 I'm BayouBytes, a tech enthusiast with a serious soft spot for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Right now, I'm diving headfirst 🏊‍♂️ into the world of Large Language Models, training them on handpicked datasets 📚 and seeing where the current can take us.

But my digital adventures don't stop there. 🚀 I'm a huge fan of all things virtual world-building 🎮. From Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) to video games and visual novels, I'm all about creating realms 🏰 where we can take a break from reality. And hey, who doesn't love a good escape every now and then? 🛸

Sure, I'm still finding my footing 👣 in these areas, but isn't that half the fun? I'm determined to keep leveling up my skills, using AI 🤖 as my guide through the thick of it all. The goal isn't just to become an expert, but to embrace the perpetual learning 📈 that comes with this vast field.

So, here's to learning, growing, and transforming the digital world 🌐, one byte at a time.
